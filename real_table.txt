// #SERVICE REQUEST STATUS SAMPLE


--> Notifications <--
https://isomorphic-furyroad.vercel.app/logistics

//  Step 1
Pending Pickup – The customer has placed a service request, but the clothes have not been picked up yet.
Ongoing Pickup – The delivery staff has picked up the clothes from the customer's location.
Completed Pickup – The delivery staff has picked up the clothes from the customer's location.


//  Step 2
At Store – The clothes have been dropped off at the laundry store.
In Queue – The clothes are waiting for an available laundry unit.
In Laundry – The clothes have been assigned to a laundry unit and are currently being washed/dried.
Laundry Completed – The clothes have finished the washing/drying process.


//  Step 3
Ready for Delivery – The clothes are ready to be delivered back to the customer.
Out for Delivery – The delivery staff is on the way to deliver the clothes to the customer.
Completed Delivery – The clothes have been delivered to the customer, and payment has been confirmed.
Canceled - its cancel the service request of the customer

For the situation where a delivery rider attempts to deliver clothes to a customer, but the customer is not home and the rider returns the clothes to the store, you can use the following status options:

Suggested Statuses:
"Attempted Delivery": This status indicates that the delivery was attempted, but it was not completed because the customer was unavailable.
"Returned to Store": This status would indicate that the delivery was unsuccessful, and the clothes were brought back to the store. It clearly describes the outcome of the failed delivery.
"Failed Delivery": This status could be used to indicate that the delivery could not be completed due to the customer not being available, and the rider returned the clothes to the store.
Example:
Request Status: "Attempted Delivery"
Notes: The rider attempted the delivery, but the customer was not home, so the clothes were returned to the store.
You can also use a combination of statuses:

Delivery Status: "Attempted"
Return Status: "Returned to Store" or "Failed Delivery"
This helps provide a clear view of the delivery attempt and its outcome, and it allows tracking of failed deliveries for follow-up or reattempting.
